# Authentication

In order for you to use the Paysafe REST API, Paysafe must first set you up on their system
and provide you with an API key. Your API key looks something like this:

 * Key Username – MerchantXYZ
 * Key Password – B-tst1-0-51ed39e4-312d02345d3f123120881dff9bb4020a89e8ac44cdfdcecd702151182fdc952272661d290ab2e5849e31bb03deede7e

Note that this is not the same as your Merchant Back Office username and password.

The case-sensitive API key is sent using HTTP Basic Authentication. To use HTTP Basic Authentication, you must send the API key credentials using the Authorization header with every request. The Authorization header is constructed as follows:

 1. The Key Username and Key Password are combined into a string separated by a colon, e.g.,“Key Username:Key Password”.
 2. The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64.
 3. The authorization method and a space (i.e., “Basic”) are then put before the encoded string.

For example, using the Key Username and Password examples above, the header is formed as follows:

``Authorization: Basic
TWVyY2hhbnRYWVo6Qi10c3QxLTAtNTFlZDM5ZTQtMzEyZDAyMzQ1ZDNmMTIzMTIwODgxZGZmOWJiNDAyMGE4OWU4YWM0NGNkZmRjZWNkNzAyMTUxMTgyZmRjOTU yMjcyNjYxZDI5MGFiMmU1ODQ5ZTMxYmIwM2RlZWRlN2U=``

For additional details, please refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).

**Note:** Your Production API key will be different from your Test API key. Contact your account manager for details. You must keep your API keys safe and ensure that it is used appropriately for your needs.

<a name="pagination" title="Pagination"></a>
# Pagination

In the case where an API GET request returns multiple results, Paysafe returns the first 10 records by default and uses HATEOAS links to provide page navigation. In addition to the default behavior, it is also possible to control the number of results and starting point by passing in query parameters as follows:

|    Name       | Description   |
|---            |---            |
| limit         | This is the total number of records to return. Max = 50. Default = 10. |
| offset        | This is the starting position, where 0 is the first record. Default = 0. |
| startDate     | This is the start date in UTC. Default = 30 days before the *endDate*.|
| endDate       | This is the end date in UTC. Default = current date and time. |

You must not include any of the characters in the following table as values in any of your request parameters except in the [merchantDescriptor](#merchantdescriptorobject) Object. If you do, your request will result in an error.

|    Character    |    HEX    |    Description                     |

## level2level3

Level 2 and Level 3 (L2/L3) credit card processing refers to certain B2B card transactions for which the merchant might be eligible for lower credit card interchange rates. The lower rates may be available for 
merchants who provide more detailed information when processing card-not-present transactions. In order to be eligible for L2/L3 transactions:
 * Your merchant account must be properly configured by Paysafe.
 * The BIN of the credit card used for the transaction must be eligible – typically, these are government-issued credit cards.

<a name="recipientobject" title="recipient Object"></a>
## recipient 

The recipient is deemed to be the person or party who has the contractual relationship with the merchant/financial institution. This may be different from the cardholder, e.g., in the case of a parent topping up a child's savings account. Therefore, the fields should not be collected on the same page as cardholder information, but instead be passed in the background from the merchant’s records.

**Note:** You can include *recipient* elements in your [authorization request](#authrequest) **only if** your Merchant Category Code is **6012** and your registered trading address is in the United Kingdom. All fields are optional. However, scheme fines may apply if data is consistently not supplied and chargebacks persist. If you have any questions, contact your account manager.
If you are using a payment token for an Authorization request and there is already recipient data for the consumer profile associated with the payment token, then if you include the *recipient* object in the Authorization, this data will override the recipient data already in the profile.

If you [look up an authorization request](#getauth)  that used the *visaAdditionalAuthData* parameter (now deprecated), the response will contain the relevant data in both the *recipient* and the *visaAdditionalAuthData* objects.

<a name="storedcredentialobject" title="storedCredential Object"></a>
## storedCredential

The *storedCredential* object is used to identify [authorization requests](#authrequest) that use stored credentials for a consumer, in order to improve authorization rates and reduce fraud. Stored credentials can be used in two cases: 
 - Using a payment token &ndash; An authorization request that uses a *paymentToken* from the [Customer Vault API](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/vault/api/)
 - Using a card number &ndash; An authorization request that uses a credit card number stored by the merchant 

**Notes:** 
 - If you use a *paymentToken* in the authorization request but do not include the *storedCredential* object, Paysafe will provide default information taken from Customer Vault data.
 - You cannot include both the *storedCredential* object and the *recurring* parameter in the same authorization request. Paysafe recommends using the *storedCredential* object.
 - The *cvv* parameter of the [card object](#cardobject) is required when the *occurrence* parameter is set to *INITIAL*. However, *cvv* is not required when the *occurrence* parameter is set to *SUBSEQUENT*.
 - The *storedCredential* object cannot be used for Apple Pay or Google Pay transactions.

# Using the Example API Calls (Console Window)
To configure and test the API examples, first click on one of the API calls in the API Reference section and then click **Switch to Console** in the right hand pane.
Using the Console window you can update the headers, the request body, and parts of the API endpoint.
For example, for many requests you must update the endpoint to include your account ID, which you do by selecting **URI Parameters** and then updating the **account_id** value.
(To get your account ID, log into the Paysafe Back Office, choose **Accounts** and look in the *Account* column).
You must also update the Header to include your API Key by selecting **Headers** and then updating the **Authorization** value using the Base64
version of your API key. To get your API key, log into the Test version of the Merchant Back Office and choose **Settings > API Key**.
Click *View Base 64 Encoded* and copy the key to your clipboard. Paste the key after the word Basic to replace the text YOUR-BASE64-ENCODED-API-KEY.
When you are ready to test your example, you can choose between the Production and Mock server environment:
* Production server – This calls the resource on Paysafe's Test system.
* Mock server – This environment simply returns the dummy values in the example response irrespective of the parameters you supply. You do not need to use your account ID or Test API key for this request.

To call the API resource, click **Call Resource**. The response is displayed in the Console window.

## Authorization [POST /v1/accounts/{account_id}/auths]
<a name="authrequest" title="Authorization Request"></a>

Click on **Authorization** above to see four examples of an Authorization request: 

* An Authorization request that will have to be settled later
* A purchase request, which authorizes and settles the payment in a single request by setting the *settleWithAuth* parameter to *true*
* An Authorization request using a payment token
* An Authorization including 3D Secure 1.0.2 authentication data 
* An Authorization including 3D Secure 2 authentication data
* A Regular Authorization with ignored airline travel details for AIRLINE merchants only
* A purchase request, which authorizes and settles the payment in a single request by setting the *settleWithAuth* parameter to *true* for AIRLINE merchants only


In the case of an Authorization request using a payment token, you can use either of two payment token types:

* The permanent, reusable payment token that you receive in the response to a Customer Vault [card creation request](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/payments/vault/api/#/reference/0/cards/create-a-card)
* The temporary payment token that you receive in the response to a Customer Vault [mobile single-use token creation request](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/payments/vault/api/#/reference/0/mobile-device-single-use-tokens/create-a-mobile-device-single-use-token),  [Google Pay single-use token creation request](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/vault/api/#/reference/single-use-tokens/google-payment-api-single-use-tokens/create-a-google-payment-api-single-use-token),or [Apple Pay single-use token creation request](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/payments/vault/api/#/reference/0/apple-pay-single-use-tokens/create-an-apple-pay-single-use-token), or when using the [Paysafe.js SDK](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/sdks/paysafejs/tokenize/)

## Verification [POST /v1/accounts/{account_id}/verifications]
<a name="verificationrequest" title="Verification Request"></a>

Click on **Verification** above to see two examples of a Verification request to verify card details:

* A Verification request using card details
* A Verification request using a payment token

In the case of a payment token, you can use either of two payment token types:

* The permanent, reusable payment token that you receive in the response to a Customer Vault [card creation request](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/payments/vault/api/#/reference/0/cards/create-a-card)
* The temporary payment token that you receive in the response to a Customer Vault [mobile single-use token creation request](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/payments/vault/api/#/reference/0/mobile-device-single-use-tokens/create-a-mobile-device-single-use-token) or when using the [Paysafe.js SDK](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/sdks/paysafejs/tokenize/)

You **cannot** use [Apple Pay single-use tokens](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/vault/api/#/reference/single-use-tokens/apple-pay-single-use-tokens/create-an-apple-pay-single-use-token) or [Google Pay single-use tokens](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/vault/api/#/reference/single-use-tokens/google-payment-api-single-use-tokens/create-a-google-payment-api-single-use-token) in Verification requests.

**Note**<ul><li>If you use a payment token that **does not** have an address associated with it, you must include the *billingDetails* object in this request in order to pass an Address Verification (AVS) check.</li><li>If you use a payment token that **does** have an address associated with it and you include the *billingDetails* object, the address information included in the *billingDetails* object will override the address information associated with the payment token, for this transaction request only.</li><li>If you intend to use the Customer Vault API to [convert a single-use payment token into a permanent payment token](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/payments/vault/api/#/reference/0/profiles/create-a-profile-using-a-single-use-token), you should verify the token using this Card Payments API request before proceeding with the conversion.</li></ul>

# Original Credits [/originalcredits]
<a name="originalcredits" title="Original Credits"></a>

Original Credits allow merchants with specific merchant category codes (MCCs) to issue winnings as credits to cardholders, without requiring a previous Authorization/Settlement. 

**Note:** Acquirers and processors do not necessarily support all available MCCs; before integrating, you should contact [Integration Support](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/resources-and-support/contact-us/) for details.

Worldpay Inc. (formerly Vantiv) supports Original Credit transactions with the following MCCs:
 * 5816
 * 7800
 * 7801
 * 7802
 * 7994

Original Credit transfers are supported for non-Worldpay Inc. merchants with the following MCCs:
 * 7994
 * 7995

By default, Test accounts do not support Original Credits; if you wish to use them you should contact [Integration Support](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/resources-and-support/contact-us/).

<a name="originalcreditrequest" title="Original Credit Request"></a>

Click on **Original Credit** above to see two examples of an Original Credit request:

* An Original Credit request using card information
* An Original Credit request using a payment token

In the case of a payment token, you can use either of two payment token types:

* The permanent, reusable payment token that you receive in the response to a Customer Vault [card creation request](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/payments/vault/api/#/reference/0/cards/create-a-card)
* The temporary payment token that you receive in the response to a Customer Vault [mobile single-use token creation request](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/payments/vault/api/#/reference/0/mobile-device-single-use-tokens/create-a-mobile-device-single-use-token) or when using the [Paysafe.js SDK](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/sdks/paysafejs/tokenize/)

You **cannot** use [Apple Pay single-use tokens](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/vault/api/#/reference/single-use-tokens/apple-pay-single-use-tokens/create-an-apple-pay-single-use-token) or [Google Pay single-use tokens](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/vault/api/#/reference/single-use-tokens/google-payment-api-single-use-tokens/create-a-google-payment-api-single-use-token) in Original Credit requests.

# Standalone Credits [/standalonecredits]
<a name="standalonecredits" title="Standalone Credits"></a>

Standalone Credits allow merchants to issue credits to cardholders without requiring a previous Authorization/Settlement.

**Note:** If your merchant category code (MCC) is listed as able to [process Original Credits](#originalcredits), you must not use Standalone Credits.

By default, Test accounts do not support Standalone Credits; if you wish to use them you should contact [Integration Support](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/resources-and-support/contact-us/). 

## Standalone Credit [POST /v1/accounts/{account_id}/standalonecredits]
<a name="standalonecreditrequest" title="Standalone Credit Request"></a>

Click on **Standalone Credit** above to see two examples of a Standalone Credit request:

* A Standalone Credit request using card information
* A Standalone Credit request using a payment token

In the case of a payment token, you can use either of two payment token types:

* The permanent, reusable payment token that you receive in the response to a Customer Vault [card creation request](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/payments/vault/api/#/reference/0/cards/create-a-card)
* The temporary payment token that you receive in the response to a Customer Vault [mobile single-use token creation request](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/payments/vault/api/#/reference/0/mobile-device-single-use-tokens/create-a-mobile-device-single-use-token) or when using the [Paysafe.js SDK](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/sdks/paysafejs/tokenize/)

You **cannot** use [Apple Pay single-use tokens](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/vault/api/#/reference/single-use-tokens/apple-pay-single-use-tokens/create-an-apple-pay-single-use-token) or [Google Pay single-use tokens](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/vault/api/#/reference/single-use-tokens/google-payment-api-single-use-tokens/create-a-google-payment-api-single-use-token) in Standalone Credit requests.
