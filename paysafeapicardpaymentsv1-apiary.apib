# Authentication

In order for you to use the Paysafe REST API, Paysafe must first set you up on their system
and provide you with an API key. Your API key looks something like this:
 * Username – MerchantXYZ
 * Password – B-tst1-0-51ed39e4-312d02345d3f123120881dff9bb4020a89e8ac44cdfdcecd702151182fdc952272661d290ab2e5849e31bb03deede7e

Note that this is not the same as your Merchant Back Office username and password.

The case-sensitive API key is sent using HTTP Basic Authentication. To use HTTP Basic Authentication, you must send the API key credentials using the Authorization header with every request. The Authorization header is constructed as follows:
 1. The Key Username and Key Password are combined into a string separated by a colon, e.g.,“Key Username:Key Password”.
 2. The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64.
 3. The authorization method and a space (i.e., “Basic”) are then put before the encoded string.

For example, using the Key Username and Password examples above, the header is formed as follows:

``Authorization: Basic
TWVyY2hhbnRYWVo6Qi10c3QxLTAtNTFlZDM5ZTQtMzEyZDAyMzQ1ZDNmMTIzMTIwODgxZGZmOWJiNDAyMGE4OWU4YWM0NGNkZmRjZWNkNzAyMTUxMTgyZmRjOTU yMjcyNjYxZDI5MGFiMmU1ODQ5ZTMxYmIwM2RlZWRlN2U=``

For additional details, please refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).

**Note:** Your Production API key will be different from your Test API key. Contact your account manager for details. You must keep your API keys safe and ensure that it is used appropriately for your needs.

<a name="pagination" title="Pagination"></a>
# Pagination

In the case where an API GET request returns multiple results, Paysafe returns the first 10 records by default and uses HATEOAS links to provide page navigation. In addition to the default behavior, it is also possible to control the number of results and starting point by passing in query parameters as follows:

|    Name       | Description   |
|---            |---            |
| limit         | This is the total number of records to return. Max = 50. Default = 10. |
| offset        | This is the starting position, where 0 is the first record. Default = 0. |
| startDate     | This is the start date in UTC. Default = 30 days before the *endDate*.|
| endDate       | This is the end date in UTC. Default = current date and time. |

<a name="globalinvalidcharacters" title="Global Invalid Characters"></a>
# Global Invalid Characters

You must not include any of the characters in the following table as values in any of your request parameters. If you do, your request will result in an error.

|    Character    |    HEX    |    Description                     |
|-----------------|-----------|------------------------------------|
| "               | 22        | Double quotes (or speech marks)    |

## level2level3

Level 2 and Level 3 (L2/L3) credit card processing refers to certain B2B card transactions for which the merchant might be eligible for lower credit card interchange rates. The lower rates may be available for 
merchants who provide more detailed information when processing card-not-present transactions. In order to be eligible for L2/L3 transactions:
 * Your merchant account must be properly configured by Paysafe.
 * The BIN of the credit card used for the transaction must be eligible – typically, these are government-issued credit cards.

## visaAdditionalAuthData

The recipient is deemed to be the person or party who has the contractual relationship with the merchant/financial institution. This may be different from the cardholder, e.g., in the case of a parent topping up a child's savings account. Therefore, the fields should not be collected on the same page as cardholder information, but instead be passed in the background from the merchant’s records.

**Note:** Include *recipientDateOfBirth* elements if your Merchant Category Code is 6012 and your registered trading address is in the United Kingdom. If you have any questions, contact your account manager. All fields are optional. However, scheme fines may apply if data is consistently not supplied and chargebacks persist.

# Using the example API calls (Console Window)
To configure and test the API examples, first click on one of the API calls in the API Reference section and then click **Switch to Console** in the right hand pane.
Using the Console window you can update the headers, the request body, and parts of the API endpoint.
For example, for many requests you must update the endpoint to include your account ID, which you do by selecting **URI Parameters** and then updating the **account_id** value.
(To get your account ID, log into the Paysafe Back Office, choose **Accounts** and look in the *Account* column).
You must also update the Header to include your API Key by selecting **Headers** and then updating the **Authorization** value using the Base64
version of your API key. To get your API key, log into the Test version of the Merchant Back Office and choose **Settings > API Key**.
Click *View Base 64 Encoded* and copy the key to your clipboard. Paste the key after the word Basic to replace the text YOUR-BASE64-ENCODED-API-KEY.
When you are ready to test your example, you can choose between the Production and Mock server environment:
* Production server – This calls the resource on Paysafe's Test system.
* Mock server – This environment simply returns the dummy values in the example response irrespective of the parameters you supply. You do not need to use your account ID or Test API key for this request.

To call the API resource, click **Call Resource**. The response is displayed in the Console window.

This is how you submit a Verification request using a payment token.

When you use a payment token, you can submit the request without extra parameters such as card, profile, and billing address information. When provided, these details are stored in the Customer Vault with the payment token. 

You can use either of two payment token types:<ul><li>The permanent, reusable payment token that you receive in the response to a Customer Vault [card creation request](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/payments/vault/api/#/reference/0/cards/create-a-card)</li><li>The temporary payment token that you receive in the response to a Customer Vault [mobile single-use token creation request](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/payments/vault/api/#/reference/0/mobile-device-single-use-tokens/create-a-mobile-device-single-use-token) or [Apple Pay single-use token creation request](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/payments/vault/api/#/reference/0/apple-pay-single-use-tokens/create-an-apple-pay-single-use-token), or when using the [Paysafe.js SDK](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/sdks/paysafejs/tokenize/)</li></ul>

**Note**<ul><li>If you use a payment token that **does not** have an address associated with it, you must include the *billingDetails* object in this request in order to pass an Address Verification (AVS) check.</li><li>If you use a payment token that **does** have an address associated with it and you include the *billingDetails* object, the address information included in the *billingDetails* object will override the address information associated with the payment token, for this transaction request only.</li><li>If you intend to use the Customer Vault API to [convert a single-use payment token into a permanent payment token](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/payments/vault/api/#/reference/0/profiles/create-a-profile-using-a-single-use-token), you should verify the token using this Card Payments API request before proceeding with the conversion.</li></ul>
